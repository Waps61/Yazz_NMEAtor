  The printNumber function uses two overloaded functions that keep your column-numbers
  steady, regardless of size or sign, by converting each number to a string then
  pre-padding each column-width with spaces. The column-widths, which are currently
  set to 6 may be altered by changing each "6" to "whatever-the-number-will-fit-into".

  The overloaded functions accept "float" and "short" numbers.
